In this project I have made a RL agent that learns from a bsuite environment and chooses the best action that would result in high reward.Classical algorithms including Q - learning, Double Q learning, SARSE with other techniques such as tile - coding etc have been also implemented.
The bsuite library for the environments have been chosen and implemented.

The agent have been tested on these environments namely 

1. CATCH
2. CARTPOLE
3. MOUNTAIN CAR
4. CATCH NOISE
5. CARTPOLE NOISE
6. MOUNTAIN CAR NOISE

All the other details are in the notebooks
